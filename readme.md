<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mohid Yousaf</h1>
<h3 align="center">Developer, Teacher, and Gem Collector</h3>

<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
As a full-stack developer with over three years of experience, I specialize in developing mobile applications, website development, and backend systems. I am highly proficient in RESTful APIs development and database integration using a variety of technologies including MongoDB, MySQL, Firebase, Neo4J, and GraphQL, as well as cloud services such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Heroku. Additionally, I have experience working with Git for version control, UI/UX design, and Agile development methodologies. During my career, I have managed central backends for multiple web portals and apps for product-based companies. I have deep experience with graph-based and relational/non-relational database systems such as Neo4j, Postgres, and Firebase. I have written raw Cypher queries for database interactions, enabling me to deliver effective and efficient solutions quickly. I have also completed numerous freelancing projects with a solid architecture, working with both Flutter and React for front-end development. I take pride in my communication and collaboration skills and ensure effective collaboration with clients and teams to bring their ideas to life.
