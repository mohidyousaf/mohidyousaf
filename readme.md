<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
As an AI Automation Architect and Senior Full-Stack Developer with 4+ years of experience, I specialize in designing intelligent, autonomous systems and partnering with founders to build market-ready platforms from the ground up. My focus is on moving beyond simple coding to architecting robust solutions that solve core business challengesâ€”whether it's modernizing a legacy application for a major US company, engineering a multi-lingual AI voice agent, or building an entire AI-powered sales team from scratch. I leverage a modern tech stack centered on <strong>n8n for automation</strong>, <strong>Next.js/React for front-end</strong>, and <strong>Node.js for backend</strong> to ship measurable improvements in performance, efficiency, and reliability.
